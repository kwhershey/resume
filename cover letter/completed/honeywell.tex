Please find my enclosed application for the open "Research Scientist II" position at Honeywell.  
I expect to graduate in the early summer of 2018 with a  Ph.D in Materials Science and Engineering working with Prof. Russell Holmes at the University of Minnesota (UMN).  
%During my time as a graduate student, I have been funded by a University Partnership Initiative from the Dow Chemical Company, collaborating with Dow technical personnel  in Michigan, Massachusetts and Korea.  
%I have become well acquainted with the strong research environment available at Dow and would be very interested in becoming a part of this excellent team.  
My background in research and coursework has made me a strong problem solver and I am confident I would be a valuable addition to the Honeywell team.

My graduate work on understanding kinetic processes of Organic Light-Emitting Devices (OLEDs) on multiple time scales has prepared me well to approach research problems related to semiconductor materials and electronics.  
Through manufacturing and characterizing OLEDs, my research investigated the fundamental physics of energy transfer within these devices leading to light formation.  
I explored both the transient kinetics at sub microsecond time scales, as well as degradation during the operational lifetime, developing novel experimental techniques to expose new information which enabled deeper understanding and further optimization of devices. 
At the University of Minnesota, as well as several research opportunities, I have worked with a variety of electronics manufacturing and testing equipment, including vacuum thin film deposition, wafer processing and bonding techniques.
In addition to my experimental work, I have made significant improvements to data acquisition and storage capabilities within the laboratory.  
This has included designing multiplexed laboratory equipment, including testing hardware design, writing testing and control software, and integrating the collected data into a central storage database.  

%This level integration between the laboratory and the collected data was required as I developed new laboratory equipment capable of multiplexing our operational lifetime apparatus.  

I believe the experience and technical skills I have acquired (outlined in my attached resume) have prepared me well to tackle challenges at Honeywell.  
My broad research background makes me a strong candidate to work in a wide range of positions.
As a materials engineer with experience in semiconductor device manufacturing, device physics, software development, and data management, I would be very excited to have the opportunity to work at Honeywell.  
I look forward to speaking with you more about how I could contribute.  
Please contact me if you have any questions.
