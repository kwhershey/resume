Please find my attached application for the open "Process Data Scientist" position at \company{}.
I expect to graduate with a Ph.D in Materials Science and Engineering in the summer of 2018, having worked with Prof. Russell Holmes at the University of Minnesota (UMN).
While working on my Ph.D, I have had the privilege of touring the \shortcompany{}  campus and giving a poster presentation in the 3M Innovation Center, as well as attending informational sessions about \company{} on the UMN campus.
I have been very impressed with the spirit of collaborative innovation that \company{} fosters and am excited for the opportunity to join this team.
My background in data science and experimental research has given me a breadth of experience that I am confident I would be a valuable addition to \company{}.
Given my background, I have developed a unique skill set for developing measurement systems and integrating them with data collection systems, as well as using data science techniques to realize the full potential of experimental data.

%My graduate work on understanding kinetic processes of Organic Light-Emitting Devices (OLEDs) on multiple time scales has prepared me well to approach research problems related to materials.
%Through manufacturing and characterizing OLEDs, my research investigated the fundamental physics of energy transfer within these devices leading to light formation.
%I explored both the transient kinetics at short times, as well as degradation during the operational lifetime, developing novel experimental techniques to expose new information which enabled deeper understanding and further optimization of the underlying physics. 

My graduate work has focused on the characterization and optimization of Organic Light-Emitting Devices (OLEDs).  
This has involved designing and creating novel measurement equipment to characterize device behavior.
I developed multiple light sensing apparatus for detecting signal changes over microsecond time scales, as well as operational lifetime characterization over hundreds of hours.  
I have designing and implementing optical and mechanical systems to implement novel science which has resulted in one of a kind experimental setups.

I think one of the most influential aspects of my work in creating lab equipment and measurement apparatus has been in controlling the collected data.  
In designing the control software for equipment, I have integrated the collected data into a research database which does all data analysis and connects experimental details to measurements.
This system has allowed rapid comparison of experiments and enables seemless data mining of experimental results.  
By implementimenting data collection intimately with analysis and data mining techniques, our research group mentality has changed dramatically and we are able to look at much larger trends in our experiments that were previously possible.


%In addition to my experimental work, I have taken the initiative to make significant improvements in data acquisition and analysis capabilities within the laboratory.
%This has included designing multiplexed laboratory equipment, writing testing and control software, and integrating the collected data into a central storage database.
%Inspired by the high-throughput systems used in industrial research, this has allowed for seamless collection of data along with an ability to quickly compare multiple datasets across any parameter. 
%These capabilities are changing the way that our research group is able to look at experimental trends and provides a deeper insight into data we have collected.
%This level integration between the laboratory and the collected data was required as I developed new laboratory equipment capable of multiplexing our operational lifetime apparatus.  

%The technical expertise I have acquired has prepared me well to tackle challenges at \company{}.
I know my unique multifaceted perspective and passion would be an asset to the cutting edge research team at \company{}.
%My research in understanding device physics of OLEDs has made me a strong candidate for working on analytical research. 
My experience with designing laboratory equipment and writing data collection and analysis software % finish
% data science sentence
   My experimental research has given me a deep understanding of how lab science is conducted. % explain how this gives me a leg up over data scientists.  I have lab experience

I would be very excited to have the opportunity to work in the \shortcompany{}  environment.
I look forward to speaking with you more about how I could contribute to \company{}.
Please contact me if you have any questions.
